# Archive Feature - Quick Start Guide

## What is the Archive Feature?

The archive feature lets you temporarily hide channels you're not actively working on. Think of it as putting channels "on the shelf" - they're still there, just out of sight until you need them again.

## Why Use It?

- **Keep your dashboard clean**: Focus only on channels you're actively managing
- **Don't lose data**: Unlike deleting, archiving preserves everything
- **Easy to restore**: Bring channels back anytime with one click
- **Better organization**: Separate active projects from paused ones

## Quick Actions

### Archive a Channel
```
Dashboard → Find Channel → Click Archive Icon (📦) → Confirm
```

### View Archived Channels
```
Dashboard → Click "Show Archived" Button
```

### Restore a Channel
```
Show Archived View → Find Channel → Click Unarchive Icon (↑) → Confirm
```

## Visual Guide

### Active Channels View (Default)
- Shows only channels you're currently working on
- Stats show counts for active channels only
- Each channel has an **Archive** button (gray box icon)
- Toggle button says "Show Archived"

### Archived Channels View
- Shows only archived channels
- Stats show counts for archived channels only
- Each channel has an **Unarchive** button (green up arrow icon)
- Toggle button says "Show Active"

## Button Locations

On each channel card, you'll see icons in the top-right corner:

**Active View:**
- 🟢/🟡/🔴 Status Badge (On Track/Due Soon/Overdue)
- 📦 Archive Button (gray)
- 🗑️ Delete Button (red)

**Archived View:**
- 🟢/🟡/🔴 Status Badge
- ↑ Unarchive Button (green)
- 🗑️ Delete Button (red)

## Common Use Cases

### Seasonal Channels
Archive channels that are only active during certain times of the year.

### Paused Projects
Archive channels for projects you've temporarily put on hold.

### Testing/Experimental Channels
Archive test channels you might want to reference later.

### Completed Series
Archive channels for completed video series you might revisit.

## Tips

1. **Archive, don't delete**: Unless you're 100% sure you won't need the channel again, archive it instead of deleting
2. **Regular cleanup**: Review your active channels monthly and archive inactive ones
3. **Quick restore**: Archived channels can be restored instantly - no data loss
4. **Editors still have access**: Editors assigned to archived channels can still view them in the archived view

## What Gets Preserved?

When you archive a channel, everything is kept:
- ✅ Channel settings and configuration
- ✅ YouTube URL and target posting time
- ✅ Inspiration channels
- ✅ Editor assignments
- ✅ Video history and tasks
- ✅ All statistics and data

The only thing that changes is the channel won't appear in your active dashboard view.
