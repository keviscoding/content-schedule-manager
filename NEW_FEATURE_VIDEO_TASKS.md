# ðŸŽ¬ NEW FEATURE: Video Task Assignments

## What's New

You can now assign video editing tasks to your editors! This creates a clear workflow for managing pending work.

## How It Works

### For Channel Owners:

1. **Create a task** for an editor
2. **(Optional)** Upload raw footage for them to edit
3. **Track progress** as they work
4. **Review** when they upload the finished video
5. **Approve/Reject** the final video

### For Editors:

1. **See your tasks** - All assignments in one place
2. **Mark in-progress** - Let the owner know you're working
3. **Download raw footage** (if provided)
4. **Upload finished video** when done
5. **Mark complete** - Link your video to the task

## Quick Example

```bash
# Owner creates task
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/video-tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer OWNER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "channelId": "CHANNEL_ID",
    "assignedToId": "EDITOR_ID",
    "title": "Edit gaming highlights",
    "instructions": "60 seconds, fast cuts, epic music",
    "dueDate": "2025-01-20T14:00:00Z"
  }'

# Editor sees task
curl http://localhost:3001/api/video-tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer EDITOR_TOKEN"

# Editor marks in progress
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3001/api/video-tasks/TASK_ID/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer EDITOR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"status":"in-progress"}'

# Editor uploads finished video
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/videos/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer EDITOR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{...video details...}'

# Editor completes task
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/video-tasks/TASK_ID/complete \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer EDITOR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"videoId":"VIDEO_ID"}'
```

```

This will:

## API Endpoints

- `POST /:id/complete` - Complete task (editor)

## Task Statuses

- **pending** - Just created, waiting for editor
- **in-progress** - Editor is working on it
- **completed** - Editor uploaded finished video
- **cancelled** - Task was cancelled

## Benefits
