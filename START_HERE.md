## Quick Test

```bash
# Test all the APIs
./test-api.sh
```

## What Works Right Now

### Via API (fully functional):
- Register/login users
- Create channels with posting schedules
- Add inspiration channels for each channel
- Assign editors to channels
- Upload videos
- Approve/reject videos
- Mark videos as posted
- View posting history

### Via UI (basic):
- Login/register page only
- Rest needs to be built (see tasks.md)

## How to Use It

### Option 1: Use the API Directly
```bash
# Register
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"you@example.com","password":"pass","name":"You","role":"owner"}'

# Create channel
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/channels \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"My Channel","youtubeUrl":"https://youtube.com/@me","targetPostingTime":"14:00"}'
```

### Option 2: Build the Frontend
Follow the tasks in `.kiro/specs/content-schedule-manager/tasks.md`

### Option 3: Deploy and Use
See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for Digital Ocean deployment

## Digital Ocean Deployment

### Quick Deploy (App Platform):
1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect to DO App Platform
3. Deploy backend + frontend separately
4. Done!

### Full Control (Droplet):
```bash
# On your droplet
git clone your-repo
cd content-schedule-manager
./deploy-digitalocean.sh
```

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for complete instructions.

## What's Next

### To Use It Now:
1. Deploy the backend
2. Use the API directly
3. Build a simple frontend or use Postman

### To Complete It:
1. Build the dashboard UI (Task 9)
2. Add deadline monitoring (Task 6)
3. Add notifications (Task 7)
4. Build remaining UI pages (Tasks 10-14)

See `.kiro/specs/content-schedule-manager/tasks.md` for all tasks.
