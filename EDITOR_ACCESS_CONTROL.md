className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6"
// Change to 4 columns:
className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-6"
```

### Add More Stats
Edit the stats cards section:
```typescript
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-4 gap-6 mb-8">
  {/* Add new stat card */}
  <div className="bg-white rounded-2xl shadow-lg p-6">
    {/* Your stat content */}
  </div>
</div>
```

### Customize Editor List
Edit `frontend/src/pages/ManageEditors.tsx`:
```typescript
// Change avatar colors
className="bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-500 to-pink-500"
// Change to blue:

```

## Next Steps

Consider adding:
- **Editor Permissions**: Different permission levels (view-only, upload-only, full-access)
- **Bulk Assignment**: Assign multiple editors at once
- **Editor Groups**: Create groups of editors for easier management
- **Activity Log**: Track what editors do on each channel
- **Editor Stats**: Show performance metrics per editor
- **Notifications**: Notify editors when assigned to channels

## Troubleshooting

### Editor sees all channels
- Check backend `/api/channels` endpoint
- Verify ChannelEditor assignments in MongoDB
- Check user role is 'editor'

### Cannot add editor
- Verify editor exists in database
- Check owner has permission
- Verify editor not already assigned
- Check backend logs for errors

### Editor dashboard empty
- Verify editor is assigned to channels
- Check ChannelEditor collection in MongoDB
- Verify tasks are assigned to editor
- Check backend API responses

---

**Status**: ✅ Complete!

Editors now have full access control with their own dashboard, and owners can easily manage editor assignments per channel.
