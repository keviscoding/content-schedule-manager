# Workflow Redesign - Simplified User Experience

## 🎯 Problems Identified

1. ❌ Editor can add tasks to videos (shouldn't be able to)
2. ❌ Videos from one channel appear in all channels
3. ❌ Editor has to choose which channel to upload to (confusing)
4. ❌ Editor can see "Manage Editors" and "Inspiration" (shouldn't)
5. ❌ Adding tasks is complicated for owners
6. ❌ Overall workflow is confusing

## ✅ New Simplified Workflow

### **For Editors:**
```
1. Login → See "My Tasks" dashboard
2. Click task → See task details
3. Click "Upload Video" → Upload (no channel selection)
4. Done! Wait for owner approval
```

**What Editors Can Do:**
- ✅ See assigned tasks
- ✅ Upload videos for tasks
- ✅ See their upload history
- ❌ Can't choose channels
- ❌ Can't add tasks
- ❌ Can't see manage editors
- ❌ Can't see inspiration channels

### **For Owners:**
```
1. Login → See all channels
2. Click "Tasks" → See task list
3. Click "Add Task" → Simple form:
   - Task name
   - Description
   - Assign to editor
   - Due date
4. Editor uploads video
5. Go to "Review Videos" → See all pending videos
6. Click video → Watch → Approve
7. Select which channel to post to
8. Mark as posted when published
```

**What Owners Can Do:**
- ✅ Create tasks easily
- ✅ Assign tasks to editors
- ✅ Review all videos (not per channel)
- ✅ Approve and assign to channel
- ✅ Manage editors
- ✅ See inspiration channels

## 🔄 Key Changes

### 1. Video Upload (Editor)
**Before:** Choose channel → Upload
**After:** Just upload (owner assigns channel later)

### 2. Task Creation (Owner)
**Before:** Go to channel → Add task to video
**After:** Global task list → Add task → Assign editor

### 3. Video Review (Owner)
**Before:** Per-channel video list
**After:** Global pending videos → Approve → Assign to channel

### 4. Editor Permissions
**Before:** Can see everything
**After:** Only see tasks and upload
