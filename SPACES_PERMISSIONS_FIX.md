# Fix Video Playback - Spaces Permissions

## 🎥 Problem: Can't Play Videos

If you see "No video with supported format and MIME type found", you need to configure your Space permissions.

## 🔧 Quick Fix

### Option 1: Make Space Public (Easiest)

1. Go to [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/spaces)
2. Click on **"content-manager-videos"**
3. Click **"Settings"** tab
4. Under **"File Listing"**, change to:
   - **"Public"** or **"Files are public, file listing is private"**
5. Click **"Save"**

This allows videos to be viewed but keeps the file list private.

### Option 2: Update CORS (If Space is Private)

If you want to keep the Space private, update CORS to include credentials:

1. Go to your Space → **Settings** → **CORS Configurations**
2. Update to:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": ["https://manager-app-swvmt.ondigitalocean.app", "http://localhost:5173"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE", "HEAD"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag", "Content-Type", "Content-Length"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
  }
]
```

3. Click **"Save"**

### Option 3: Use Presigned URLs (Most Secure)

This requires backend changes to generate presigned URLs for viewing (already implemented for uploads).

**Backend change needed:**
- Generate presigned URLs for GET requests
- Return those URLs instead of direct URLs
- Videos remain private but accessible via temporary URLs

---

## ✅ Recommended Solution

**For now, use Option 1** (Make Space Public):
- ✅ Easiest to set up
- ✅ Videos are still not easily discoverable (file listing is private)
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ No code changes needed

**For production, use Option 3** (Presigned URLs):
- ✅ Most secure
- ✅ Videos are completely private
- ✅ Access controlled by your app
- ❌ Requires backend changes

---

## 🔍 Check Current Settings

### In DigitalOcean Spaces:

1. Go to your Space
2. Click **"Settings"**
3. Look at **"File Listing"**:
   - If it says **"Private"** → Videos won't play
   - If it says **"Public"** or **"Files are public"** → Videos will play

---

## 🎬 After Changing Settings

1. **Save** the changes
2. **Wait 30 seconds**
3. **Refresh** the video review page
4. **Try playing** the video again
5. ✅ Should work now!

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Public Space (Option 1):
- ✅ Videos can be viewed by anyone with the URL
- ✅ File listing is still private (can't browse files)
- ⚠️ If someone has the URL, they can view the video
- ✅ Good for: Internal tools, trusted users

### Private Space with Presigned URLs (Option 3):
- ✅ Videos are completely private
- ✅ URLs expire after a set time
- ✅ Full access control
- ✅ Good for: Production, sensitive content

---

## 🚀 Quick Steps

**Right now:**
1. Go to Spaces → content-manager-videos → Settings
2. Change "File Listing" to "Files are public, file listing is private"
3. Save
4. Refresh and try playing video
5. ✅ Should work!

**Later (for production):**
- Implement presigned URLs for GET requests
- Keep Space private
- Generate temporary URLs for video playback

## 💡 Why This Happens

When a Space is **private**:
- Browser can't access files directly
- CORS headers aren't enough
- Need either public access OR presigned URLs

When a Space is **public**:
- Browser can access files directly
- CORS headers allow cross-origin requests
- Videos play normally

---

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

### Check Browser Console:
- Press F12 → Console tab
- Look for errors like:
  - "403 Forbidden" → Space is private, make it public
  - "CORS error" → Update CORS configuration
  - "404 Not Found" → Video URL is wrong

### Verify Video Uploaded:
1. Go to Spaces → content-manager-videos
2. Look for `videos/` folder
3. Check if your video file is there
4. Try downloading it directly

### Test Direct URL:
1. Copy the video URL from the error
2. Paste it in a new browser tab
3. If it downloads → Space is working, CORS issue
4. If it shows 403 → Space is private, make it public

**Quick fix: Make the Space public and videos will play immediately!** 🎉
