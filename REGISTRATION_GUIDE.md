## 💡 Tips

### For Owners:
- Register as **"Channel Owner"** (blue button)
- You can create multiple channels
- You can assign multiple editors to each channel
- You can assign the same editor to multiple channels

### For Editors:
- Register as **"Video Editor"** (purple button)
- You'll see an empty dashboard initially
- Wait for an owner to assign you to channels
- Once assigned, channels will appear on your dashboard
- You can work on multiple channels if assigned

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Can't Change Role After Registration
- Once you register, your role is permanent
- If you need to change roles, create a new account
- Use different email addresses for different roles

### Default Role
- If somehow the button doesn't work, it defaults to "owner"
- But the buttons should always work now!

### Multiple Accounts
- You can have both an owner and editor account
- Just use different email addresses
- Example:
  - Owner: `john.owner@example.com`
  - Editor: `john.editor@example.com`

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Don't see role selector
- Make sure you're on the **Register** page (not Login)
- Click "Don't have an account? Register" to switch
- The role selector only appears during registration

### Problem: Both buttons look the same
- Try clicking one - it should highlight
- Blue = Owner, Purple = Editor
- If still not working, refresh the page

### Problem: Registered as wrong role
- Unfortunately, you can't change roles
- Create a new account with a different email
- Use the correct role button this time

### Problem: Editor sees owner dashboard
- Check if you clicked the correct button during registration
- Logout and login again
- If still wrong, you registered as owner by mistake
